## 📂 Project 1: Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation (Otsu vs Sauvola)

**Objective:**  
Segment tumor regions in brain MRI slices using classical thresholding methods.

**Methods:**
- Otsu (Global Thresholding)  
- Sauvola (Adaptive Thresholding)

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Dice Score  
- Jaccard Index  

**Kaggle Notebook:**  
https://www.kaggle.com/code/naumisharanyatirth/brain-mri-tumor-segmentation  

**Key Finding:**  
Both global and adaptive thresholding perform poorly for MRI tumor segmentation due to intensity overlap between tumor and normal brain tissues.
